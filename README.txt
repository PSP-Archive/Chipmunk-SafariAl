-- Instructions for building --

*This assumes you have the PSP Toolchain setup*

1. 'cd' into 'Library Build' and type 'make'.
2. Allow the library to build; ignore the warnings.
3. Then type 'make install' (if needed, you may have to use 'sudo').
4. Attempt to build the Demo in 'Demo/src'
	-If no errors were received, you installed correctly.
	
	
-- Controls --
Simply press cross to cycle forward trough the demos. This was a rushed port,
don't expect to much.


-- Miscellaneous Information --
This version of chipmunk physics allows the user of contraints (joints) such as
Pivot, Pin, Motor, Spring, Breakable Joints, Gear, Groove, and Slide Joints.

It is possible that this newer build could contain bugs. After working with it
for some time, I have not encountered any, but please don't hesitate to report them
to me on www.homebrewheaven.net or to slembcke on his website below.

I did not make this library, all credit in that area goes to slembcke! I mearly ported it
to the PSP. 

The port itself was done pretty quickly, please notify me of any trouble you may have.
